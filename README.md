# heart-rate-sensor
Code for RaspberryPi Pico W heart rate sensor

The program was written as part of the Data Collection and Processing course.
The program could be more structured (e.g. split functionality to different files), but that was due to the time limitations experienced during the course.

The MQTT parts were written together with the course instructor, but the rest of the code is either entirely self-written or inspired by other solutions found on the internet.

The program won't be updated further because the RaspberryPi Pico W hardware isn't accessible anymore.
