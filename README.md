# heart-rate-sensor
Code for RaspberryPi Pico W heart rate sensor

The program was written as part of the Data Collection and Processing course.
Currently the program isn't too well structured, but that is due to the time limitations experienced during the course.

The MQTT parts were written together with the course instructor, but the rest of the code is either entirely self-written or inspired by other solutions found on the internet.

The program will be updated and restructured in late December 2022 / early January 2023.
